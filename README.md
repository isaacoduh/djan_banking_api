  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Secure password hashing & reset functionality
- **KYC Verification**
  - User identity verification through document submission
  - Automated approval/rejection system
- **Banking Operations**
  - Deposits, Withdrawals, and Inter-Account Transfers
  - Real-time transaction processing
  - Multi-currency support
- **Fraud Detection & Risk Management**
  - Suspicious transaction detection
  - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
  - Comprehensive logging with **Loguru**
- **Virtual Cards & Account Statements**
  - Virtual card creation and management
  - Automated PDF statement generation
- **Asynchronous Task Processing**
  - Background processing with **Celery + Redis + RabbitMQ**
  - Task monitoring with **Flower**
- **Deployment & Infrastructure**
  - Dockerized environment with **Docker Compose**
  - Reverse proxies & load balancing using **NGINX**
  - SSL certificates via **Let's Encrypt**
  - PostgreSQL as the primary database
  - Automated backups via shell scripts
  - API documentation using **Swagger/OpenAPI**
  - Email notifications for transactional updates

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django REST Framework (DRF)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Celery, Redis, RabbitMQ
- **Security**: JWT, OTP (Two-Factor Authentication), HTTPS (SSL)
- **Containerization & Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, Portainer
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Loguru, Flower
- **Scripting & Automation**: Shell scripts, Makefiles

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL
- Redis & RabbitMQ

### Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/banking-api.git
   cd banking-api
   ```
2. Set up the environment variables:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Update the `.env` file with the correct values.
3. Build and start the services:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. Apply migrations:
   ```sh
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. Create a superuser:
   ```sh
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
6. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000/api/`

## API Documentation

API documentation is generated using **Swagger/OpenAPI** and can be accessed at:

- `http://localhost:8000/docs/`

## Deployment

To deploy the application on a production server:

1. Set up an Ubuntu server
2. Install **Docker & Docker Compose**
3. Configure **NGINX as a reverse proxy**
4. Use **Let's Encrypt** to enable HTTPS
5. Deploy using `docker-compose up -d`

## Monitoring & Logs

- Use **Flower** to monitor Celery tasks: `http://localhost:5555`
- Logs are managed using **Loguru** and stored in `/var/logs/banking-api/`

## Future Improvements

- Implement AI-driven fraud detection models
- Add blockchain-based transaction verification
- Integrate AI-powered chatbots for customer support

## Conclusion

This project serves as a **real-world FinTech application**, covering crucial aspects of **secure banking APIs**. Whether you're an aspiring **FinTech developer** or looking to **level up your Django skills**, this project will help you **understand and implement modern banking-grade security measures.**
